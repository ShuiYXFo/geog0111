Do not edit the files in here: they are automatically generated from:

    python geog0111/edit_notebook.py

The script filters notebooks of the form ???_*.ipynb in notebooks to remove:

- headers and tailers
- solution2 answer cells (with `# ANSWER` in code cells)


This results in a simpler notebook form that doesn't need notebook extensions to run.
